This is the initial document.

The next lines will depict the usage.


After cloning the repo on your local environment, please follow the order below:

Install dependencies using this command:
<pre>
npm install
</pre>

then have a build and start the server using this script:
<pre>
npm run startCleanServer
</pre>

If you change something on runtime and want to see the results immediately, no need to restart the server, you can use this script:
<pre>
npm run strt
</pre>


Thanks for patience.
